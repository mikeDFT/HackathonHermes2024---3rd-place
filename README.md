ðŸš€ Welcome to the Hackathon!

Where coffee flows like a river, 
bugs multiply like rabbits,
and "it works on my machine" becomes your new mantra.

The TEAM (AbsÄ—nt Coders):
- [Ban Mihai-Constantin](https://github.com/mikeDFT)
- [Sasaran Aurelian Noris](https://github.com/DrNoris)
- [Vlad Florin Alexandru](https://github.com/11-SUSU)
- [Coste Raul Bogdan](https://github.com/bogdan-98)

Remember:
- Sleep is for the weak (but power naps are for the wise)
- Your code doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to work-ish
- Stack Overflow is your best friend
- If all else fails, try turning it off and on again

May your functions be pure, your commits be frequent,
and your demo not crash at the last minute! 

Happy Hacking! ðŸ’»âœ¨

P.S. In case of emergency, keep calm and blame the framework.
